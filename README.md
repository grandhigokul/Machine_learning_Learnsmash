## Task 1. Data preparation & confusion matrix :
A] Perform following operation on given dataset. 
a) Find Shape of Data 
b) Find Missing Values 
c) Find data type of each column 
d)Randomly divide dataset in training (75%) and testing (25%).

B] Through the diagnosis test I predicted 100 report as COVID positive, but only 45 of those were actually positive. Total 50 people in my sample were actually COVID
positive. I have total 500 samples. Create confusion matrix based on above data and find 
I. Accuracy 
II. Precision 
III. Recall 
IV. F-1 score.

## Task 2. Linear Regression Model :
Apply Linear Regression using suitable library function and predict the Month-wise temperature.

## Task 3. Clustering Techniques :
Apply K-means Clustering or Hierarchical Clustering to find the group of people who are the profitable customers for the mall owner.

## Task 4. Association Rule Mining :
There is no header in the dataset and the first row contains the first transaction, so mentioned header = None here while loading dataset. Follow following steps :
a. Data Preprocessing
b. Generate the list of transactions from the dataset
c. Train Apriori algorithm on the dataset
d. Visualize the list of rules

## Task 5. Classifier Model :
Use probabilistic approach Naive Bayes Classifier to implement SMS Spam Filtering system.
